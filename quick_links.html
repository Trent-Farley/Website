        My name is Trent Farley. I started my 
        computer science venture when boredom kicked
        in halfway through a summer in eigth grade.
        This is when I decided that it would be fun
        to look under the hood of a dumb game. Very quickly
        this became hard. There was WAY too much stuff
        in there for me not to be scared. For a 
        couple of days I sorted out the code 
        of a coolmathgames (yeah I know, super lame) and found 
        that it was kinda fun seeing the changes that can be made.
        After that day I was hooked on the idea of being able 
        to change technology around me.
