About me-
</h2>
<p>
My name is Trent Farley. I started my 
computer science venture when boredom kicked
in halfway through a summer in eigth grade.
This is when I decided that it would be fun
to look under the hood of a dumb game. Very quickly
crap got real. There was WAY too much stuff
in there for me not to be scared. For a 
couple of days I sorted out the code 
of a coolmathgames (yeah I know, super lame) and foound 
that it was kinda fun seeing the changes that can be made.
After that day I was hooked on the idea of being able 
to change technology around me.
